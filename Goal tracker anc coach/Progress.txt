### What You’ve Implemented So Far (Revised):

1. **Setup and Environment:**

   * Created a Python virtual environment.
   * Installed necessary libraries: `langchain`, `langchain-community`, and Google Generative AI SDK.
   * Attempted to integrate Google’s Gemini model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) using LangChain.

2. **Basic LLM Usage:**

   * Wrote code to call the Gemini model to generate responses.
   * Successfully generated sample outputs like a 3-step productivity routine from the model.

3. **LangChain Prompt Template:**

   * Designed a prompt template to:

     * Take user inputs `{goal_description}` and `{duration}` (weeks).
     * Convert a goal into a structured weekly habit plan in JSON format.

4. **User Input via CLI:**

   * Built a command-line interface that:

     * Accepts a goal description and duration from the user.
     * Passes inputs to the prompt template and LLM.

5. **Parsing JSON Output:**

   * Attempted to parse the LLM response as JSON for week-wise habit plans.
   * Encountered some initial parsing issues but fixed the prompt to ensure valid JSON output.

6. **Encountered Errors & Pending Issues:**

   * **Google Authentication Error**:

     * The code fails to run because Application Default Credentials (ADC) for Google Cloud are not set.
     * `google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError` is raised, blocking the LLM initialization.
   * Deprecated import warnings for LangChain resolved by switching to `langchain-community`.
   * Import errors related to `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` were encountered and partly resolved by adjusting imports.

### What Has NOT Been Done Yet:

* **Google Cloud Authentication Setup:**

  * No service account or ADC environment variable is set up yet.
  * This needs to be fixed for the Gemini model calls to work.

* **Database Integration:**

  * Saving goals and plans to a database is still to be implemented.

* **Improved CLI or UI:**

  * No enhancements beyond basic CLI input so far.

* **Additional Functionality:**

  * No progress tracking, notifications, or coaching logic yet.
